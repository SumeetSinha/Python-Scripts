Generate_DRM(GeometryFile="geometry.fei",DrmMaterial=8,WidthX=5,WidthY=5,WidthZ=5,GF_Unit_To_SI_Unit=1,Tol=1,MotionName='M5_5',OutputPath='./',TestNodeNum=None)

Assumptions of this Script
---------------------------

It assumes that the DRM Boundary is a cuboidal shape opened from top. 
It is  also assumed that the DRM boundary has a unique material tag or no

Input Parameters 
-----------------

GeometryFile          := is the name of the ESSI input file which contains at least the information (nodes and elements ) for DRM Layer
DrmMaterial           := material tag of DRM Layer
WidthX                := Width of DRM layer in X -Direction
WidthY                := Width of DRM Layer in Y-Direction 
WidthZ                := Width of DRM Layer in Z-Direction 
GF_Unit_To_SI_Unit    := Conversion factor from geometry file Unit to SI unit
Tol                   := Tolereance for searching nodes (Should be less than mesh size in SI Units)
MotionName            := DRM Input motion name. A input file with that name would be created
OutputPath            := Path where the DRM input file would be created 
TestNodeNum           := Number of Nodes after which program would terminate. By default node will generate output for all notes. Usefull for debugging.



Enter the python file := Write only the file name containing function 'getField(x,y,z,t)' without '.py' extension. 
						 Ex:- 'Field.py' will be written as 'field' without '.py'
